              The first step was to set up the environment where I could start
              building.

              I used <code>npx create-next-app@latest next-login-app</code> to
              generate the project and chose <strong>TypeScript</strong> and
              <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>. TypeScript helps catch errors early
              and makes the code more predictable, while Tailwind lets me style
              directly in components without switching between multiple files.
            </p>

              For package management, I went with <strong>pnpm</strong>. I’d
              heard from experienced developers that it’s faster than npm and
              more efficient with storage since it links shared dependencies
              instead of reinstalling them. As someone still early in full-stack
              development, trying pnpm felt like a small but meaningful step
              toward using professional-grade tools.

              The very first version of LoginApp was simple, just a single page
              with a gradient background, a white card, and a “Login” button.
              Everything was hard-coded in one file. It wasn’t scalable, but it
              gave me a starting point to test ideas and experiment with layout
              and design.

              When a user completes registration, it’s important to let them
              know everything worked. A simple confirmation screen helps give a
              smooth end to the sign-up process and guides them toward their
              next step: logging in.
            </p>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              In this update, I created a Registration Successful page and
              refined it over a few steps to match the rest of the app’s design.
            </p>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              I started with a basic success screen that included a heading, a
              short message, and a link to return to the login page. The goal
              was to keep it minimal but clear, just enough to confirm that the
              account was created and offer a next step. Here's the initial
              structure I used:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
import Link from "next/link";

export default function RegistrationSuccess() {
  return (
    &lt;main&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Registration Successful&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Your account has been created successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;Link href="/login"&gt;Go to Login&lt;/Link&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/main&gt;
  );
}
            </code></pre>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              Once the basic layout was in place, I centered the content and
              added the background. I reused the same layout system I had used
              for the login and registration pages (<code
                >min-h-screen, flex, max-w-md</code
              >) to keep the experience consistent across the app.
            </p>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              Finally, I styled the heading, message, and login link to match
              the app’s color palette and spacing. I added a gradient
              background, rounded card container, and hover transitions to the
              link.

              LoginApp: Building the Dashboard and Improving Form Interaction
            </h1>
            <p class="post-intro">Published: November 2, 2025</p>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              With the core registration flow in place, I moved on to the
              post-login experience and refined input behavior for a smoother
              user experience.
            </p>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              I added a simple dashboard page that users will see once they log
              in. It follows the design of the app, but for now it includes only
              a welcome message and a logout button. It’s minimal by design, and
              I’ll expand it later.
            </p>
            <figure class="post-image">
              <img
                src="../img/loginapp-dashboard-v1.jpg"
                alt="Dashboard preview showing welcome message and logout button"
              />
              <figcaption>

              While reviewing the login and registration forms, I noticed that
              floating labels could interfere with pointer interactions when
              clicking on the label text. To fix that, I added
              pointer-events-none to all label elements so clicking anywhere in
              the input area now reliably focuses the field.
            </p>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              Here’s how the updated label element looks in the code:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
&lt;label
  className="absolute left-3 -top-2 bg-white px-1 text-blue-500 text-sm
  transition-all peer-placeholder-shown:top-4 peer-placeholder-shown:text-gray-400
  peer-placeholder-shown:text-base peer-focus:-top-2 peer-focus:text-blue-500
  peer-focus:text-sm pointer-events-none"
&gt;
  Username
&lt;/label&gt;
            </code></pre>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              Finally, I introduced proper page titles using Next.js metadata.
              Each page now has a unique title and description, which not only
              improves accessibility and SEO but also makes navigating browser
              tabs much clearer.
            </p>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              These enhancements improve the overall experience and prepare the
              UI for the next steps.

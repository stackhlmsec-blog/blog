              A well-organized project helps me avoid confusion, find what I
              need quickly, and plan for future additions. In this post, I‘ll
              walk through how I set up the structure for my blog and why I
              think it matters.
            </p>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              <strong> Here‘s how I organized the project so far: </strong>
            </p>
            <pre><code>
blog/
  css/
    style.css
  img/
    workstation.png
  js/
    inject.js
  partials/
    footer.html
    header.html
  posts/
    blog-structure.html
    building-a-blog.html
    starting-out.html
  about.html
  all-posts.html
  index.html
            </code></pre>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              <code><strong>css/</strong></code> – holds all the styles for the
              site. Right now it‘s just one file (<code>style.css</code>), but
              keeping it in its own folder means I can expand later without
              cluttering the root directory.
            </p>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              <code><strong>img/</strong></code> – a folder for images. I only
              have one background picture right now, but the folder is ready for
              more as the site grows.
            </p>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              <code><strong>js/</strong></code> – contains the script that
              injects the header and footer into each page. This way, I only
              have to maintain those pieces in one place.
            </p>
            <p>
              <code><strong>partials/</strong></code> – stores reusable snippets
              like the header and footer. This keeps me from repeating the same
              code across multiple files and makes updates much simpler.
            </p>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              <code><strong>posts/</strong></code> – each blog post is its own
              HTML file, which keeps content separate from the rest of the
              site‘s structure.
            </p>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              <code
                ><strong>about.html, all-posts.html, index.html</strong></code
              >
              – the main pages visitors see.
            </p>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              Even though some of these folders only contain a single file at
              the moment, organizing them this way has already paid off. It
              feels easier to navigate, and I don’t have to wonder where a new
              file should go. I also learned that reusing partials isn’t just
              about saving time, it makes the whole project more consistent.

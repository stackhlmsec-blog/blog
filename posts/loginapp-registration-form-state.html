              LoginApp: Adding Form State and Input Handling
            </h1>
            <p class="post-intro">Published: October 17, 2025</p>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              After setting up the registration form structure, I wanted to
              start refining the frontend and making the form more interactive.
              In this stage, I focused on layout improvements and added state
              handling for the password fields.
            </p>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              First, I reorganized the layout using Flexbox:
            </p>
            <ul class="post-paragraph">
              <li>
                <code>flex flex-col</code> allows stacking future elements
                vertically.
              </li>
              <li><code>items-center</code> keeps everything centered.</li>
              <li>
                <code>gap-4</code> provides clean spacing between elements
                without manually adding margins.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              I also made the card more responsive by using <code>sm:p-6</code>,
              so it wouldn’t feel cramped on smaller screens. This step wasn’t
              about changing the visual design; it was about preparing the
              layout to grow smoothly as new elements are added.
            </p>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              Next, I improved input handling on both the Login and Register
              pages by adding the built-in <code>required</code> attribute to
              each input field. This prevents users from submitting empty forms
              and provides instant browser feedback.
            </p>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              To prepare for password validation, I began tracking user input
              using React state. React doesn’t automatically remember what users
              type, so I used <code>useState</code> to store and update the
              password and confirm password fields. This makes the inputs
              controlled components, meaning React keeps their values in sync as
              the user types:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
const [password, setPassword] = useState("");
const [confirmPassword, setConfirmPassword] = useState("");
            </code></pre>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              With this in place, the form now responds to user input in real
              time. It sets the foundation for upcoming features like password
              matching, real-time feedback, and conditional submission.

              I built this blog from scratch because I wanted a project that
              grows with me. I started with the essentials so I could deploy a
              working site quickly. It‘s not perfect yet, but that‘s
              intentional. Starting small helps me focus on learning,
              experimenting, and refining the blog one piece at a time, instead
              of trying to do everything at once. For now, I‘m focusing on
              frontend development, and later I‘ll explore backend and
              cybersecurity as my projects reach those stages.

              I chose to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a few reasons. First,
              they‘re the core technologies of the web, so working with them
              gives me a strong foundation. Second, they let me keep the site
              lightweight and easy to deploy on Vercel. And finally, starting
              with the basics gives me room to gradually add features while
              keeping full control over how everything works.
            </p>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              In the coming posts, I‘ll break the project down into smaller
              chunks: how I organize the project structure, handle reusable
              components like headers and footers, and improve the design over
              time. Along the way, I‘ll share lessons learned and the decisions
              I make.

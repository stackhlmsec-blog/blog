            <p class="post-paragraph">
              I wanted to make the blog site accessible online so others could
              visit it. I chose Vercel because it’s easy to use with static
              sites, integrates well with Git, and handles deployments
              automatically.
            </p>
            <h2>Step 1: Connecting the Repository</h2>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              I pushed the project to GitHub, then connected the repository to
              Vercel. Vercel automatically detected it as a static site and
              suggested the default build settings.
            </p>
            <h2>Step 2: Adjusting Paths for Deployment</h2>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              One important detail was that the inject.js script, which handles
              the header and footer, relies on relative paths. To make sure
              these worked on Vercel as well as locally, I implemented a
              depth-aware prefix in inject.js. This way, the site works
              correctly whether a page is in a subfolder or at the root.
            </p>
            <h2>Step 3: Deploying</h2>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              Once the repository was connected and paths verified, I clicked
              “Deploy”. Vercel built the site and provided a live URL, which I
              customized after. Every push to the main branch triggers an
              automatic redeploy, so the site stays up-to-date without manual
              uploads.
            </p>
            <h2>Step 4: Testing the Live Site</h2>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              I checked all pages, the header, footer, and blog posts to ensure
              they rendered correctly. All links, code snippets, and the image
              worked as expected, and the scrollable code snippets maintained
              their styling.

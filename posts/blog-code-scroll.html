              While working on the post about reusable headers and footers, I
              noticed that the code snippet in that post was too wide for the
              content box. Long lines were overflowing, which made it harder to
              read and disrupted the layout.
            </p>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              To fix this, I added a new <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> style in
              <code>style.css</code> to enable horizontal scrolling. This
              ensures that any code snippet wider than the content box can
              scroll without breaking the layout. The scroll bar is styled to
              match the site's theme for a consistent look across browsers.
            </p>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              Another issue I noticed was that the paragraph following the code
              snippet looked too close. To improve readability, I added a
              <code>margin-bottom</code> for the code blocks and a
              <code>margin-top</code> when a code snippet follows a heading
              (<code>h1, h2, h3</code>). This keeps spacing consistent and
              separates the code visually.
            </p>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              Here’s a simplified snippet of the styling I added:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
pre {
  background-color: #162032;
  color: #38bdf8;
  padding: 1rem 1.25rem;
  border-radius: 8px;
  overflow-x: auto; /* Enables horizontal scrolling so you can see a scroll bar if the content is wider than the box */
  margin-bottom: 2.5rem; /* Adds space after the code block */
}

h1 + pre,
h2 + pre,
h3 + pre {
  margin-top: 1.5rem; /* Adds space when code follows a heading */
}
            </code></pre>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              I also styled the code visually, using a dark background with
              bright blue text for high contrast and readability, and rounded
              corners to match the site’s card style. Ensuring good contrast was
              a particular focus, so the code is easy to read against the page
              background.

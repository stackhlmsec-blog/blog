            <p class="post-intro">Published: October 7, 2025</p>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              I wanted a project to practice building a full-stack application
              with modern web technologies, but also something more than just a
              functional app. LoginApp gives me a safe environment to experiment
              with security practices, helping me understand how vulnerabilities
              arise and how to address them effectively.
            </p>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              I built LoginApp with <strong>Next.js 15</strong>, which provides
              a full-stack framework for handling both frontend and backend in
              one place. Each page, like login, registration, and dashboard,
              automatically becomes a route, keeping the project structure
              simple and organized. I use <strong>React 19</strong> for the
              interface, allowing me to create reusable components for input
              fields, buttons, and forms, and manage user input with real-time
              feedback, such as checking password strength or confirming that
              both passwords match. For styling, I use
              <strong>Tailwind CSS 4</strong>, which lets me apply styles
              directly in the components without switching between files.
            </p>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              Users can register a new account, log in, and access their
              dashboard. During registration, the app offers feedback to ensure
              passwords are strong and match the confirmation. Once logged in,
              the dashboard greets the user and includes a basic logout action.
            </p>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              Security is a central focus. Passwords must meet requirements for
              minimum length, uppercase letters, numbers, and special
              characters. Forms provide real-time guidance so users can fix
              issues before submitting. These features let me practice secure
              coding while creating a smoother experience. By building them
              myself, I can experiment with vulnerabilities and learn how to
              prevent them in real-world applications.
            </p>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              I plan to add more frontend features in the future, but for now, I
              want what I’ve built to feel complete for this stage. Once the
              frontend is ready, I’ll focus on the backend and security, using
              the OWASP Top 10 list to guide the identification and mitigation
              of common vulnerabilities.
            </p>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              Stay tuned to see how this app evolves into a secure, full-stack
              Next.js application!

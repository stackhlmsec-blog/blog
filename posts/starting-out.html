              This is my very first blog post and also the launch of my first
              deployed site. üéâ

              I‚Äòve had some design ideas for a while, but wasn‚Äòt exactly sure
              what to use them for. Recently, I decided to start a blog as a way
              to put those ideas into practice and give them purpose, and also
              to follow a principle I learned from my cybersecurity instructor:
              <em>‚ÄúSee Once. Do Once. Teach Once.‚Äù</em>
            </p>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              My focus here will be on full-stack development and cybersecurity.
              I‚Äòm still at the beginning of the journey, but I want this blog to
              grow along with my skills, as a place to share what I build,
              learn, and discover.
            </p>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
              Thanks for reading. I‚Äòm excited to see where this leads.

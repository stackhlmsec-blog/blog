          <p>
            This is my very first blog post and also the launch of my first
            deployed site. ðŸŽ‰
          </p>
          <p>
            Iâ€™ve had some design ideas for a while, but wasnâ€™t exactly sure what
            to use them for. Recently, I decided to start a blog as a way to put
            those ideas into practice and give them purpose, and also to follow
            a principle I learned from my cybersecurity instructor:
            <em>"See Once. Do Once. Teach Once."</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            My focus here will be on full-stack development and cybersecurity.
            Iâ€™m still at the beginning of the journey, but I want this blog to
            grow along with my skills, as a place to share what I build, learn,
            and discover.
          </p>
          <p>Thanks for reading. Iâ€™m excited to see where this leads.</p>

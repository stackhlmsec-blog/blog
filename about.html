          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            I‘m just beginning my journey into full-stack web development and
            cybersecurity. I‘m not a developer or a security professional yet,
            but I‘m working toward that goal through continuous learning and
            building projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            This blog is my way of documenting what I learn, what I build, and
            how I grow, one step at a time. I want to share the thinking behind
            my decisions, the challenges I face, and the progress I make.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I take on projects, I care not just about building usable
            features, but about making them secure, thoughtful, and aligned with
            best practices. Whether you‘re exploring the field yourself, working
            in tech, or simply curious, I hope this space offers something
            useful, relatable, or even inspiring.
